This assumption is generally met if each group‚Äôs data is roughly normal or if the sample sizes are large enough (thanks to the central limit theorem).\nEqual Variance: The variability (spread) in each group should be approximately equal.\n\nIf these assumptions are reasonable for your data, an independent samples t-test can be a powerful tool. Here‚Äôs how the t-test works:\n\nCalculate the Mean Difference: First, we calculate the difference in means between the two groups.\nEstimate the Standard Error: Using the sample standard deviations and sizes of each group, we estimate the standard error, which tells us how much we‚Äôd expect the means to vary just by chance.\nCompute the t-statistic: The t-statistic measures how many standard errors the observed difference is from zero (our null hypothesis value, assuming no difference).\n\nThe formula for the t-statistic is:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{(\\bar{x}_B - \\bar{x}_A) - 0}{SE}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}_A\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_B\\) are the sample means for Groups A and B, respectively.

If set to FALSE, the function would perform Welch‚Äôs t-test, which does not assume equal variances.\norder = c(\"B\", \"A\"): This specifies the order in which the groups are subtracted. In this case, the mean of group A is subtracted from the mean of group B.\nalternative = \"two-sided\": This specifies that the test is two-sided, meaning we are testing if there‚Äôs a significant difference in means, regardless of the direction (either group A is greater than group B or vice versa)."
